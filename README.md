# Information Systems Security and Privacy

Exercises and lab material for the **Information Systems Security and Privacy** course
at the [Polytechnic University of Bari](https://www.poliba.it).

This repository focuses on the **low-level software security** part of the course.

Examples and exercises are designed to learn the basics of the C programming language,
especially with respect to concepts such as pointers, addresses, and memory management.

It goes without saying that anything available in this repository, including any cryptographic
primitive, is highly insecure and only has educational value.
