# Information Systems Security and Privacy

Exercises and lab material for the **Information Systems Security and Privacy** course
at the [Polytechnic University of Bari](https://www.poliba.it).

This repository focuses on the **low-level software security** part of the course.

Examples and exercises are designed to learn the basics of the C programming language,
especially with respect to concepts such as pointers, addresses, and memory management.

It goes without saying that anything available in this repository, including any cryptographic
primitive, is highly insecure and only has educational value.

### Setting up the project

> **Note:** If you are having trouble setting up the build environment or compiling,
>           consider using one of the many available online C editors/compilers.

- Install any reasonably up-to-date C compiler.
    - **Windows:** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (for the MSVC compiler).
    - **macOS:** [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) (for the clang compiler).
    - **Linux:** [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org).
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org) (3.24 or later).
- Clone this repository (or download it as a zip):
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/IvanoBilenchi/issp-c.git
    ```
- Move into the `issp-c` dir and generate the build system:
    ```console
    $ cd issp-c
    $ cmake -B build
    ```
- Build the executables:
    ```console
    $ cmake --build build
    ```
- The built executables will be located in the `build` directory.
